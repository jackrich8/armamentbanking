                        <p><b>Please read this Electronic Communications Disclosure ("eCommunications Disclosure") thoroughly - It contains important information about your legal rights.</b> This eCommunications Disclosure covers all of your accounts, products, and services with HSBC Bank USA, National Association, HSBC Securities (USA) Inc., HSBC Insurance Agency (USA) Inc. and their affiliates (collectively, "we", "us", and "our") accessible, either currently or in the future, through Personal Internet Banking (whether accessed through a personal computer or mobile device, sometimes referred to as "Mobile Banking"), our websites, or other electronic means. This includes, but is not limited to, the following account, product, and service types: deposit accounts, credit card, loan, brokerage accounts, investment advisory, insurance policies and other services.

Since some of our accounts, products or services are provided online and use electronic means to deliver some of this information, you must consent to this eCommunications Disclosure in order to use these services. At times, we may still send you paper communications, but as a basic proposition we need to know that you are willing to receive communications electronically that we may otherwise be required to provide on paper and that you have the hardware and software needed to access to this information (and note that in Section No. 3 below, we explain ways to obtain selected disclosures or other information on paper even after you have consented to this eCommunications Disclosure).</p>

                                <p>This Agreement between you and HSBC Bank USA, N.A. ("HSBC") governs the use of Personal Internet Banking services. These services permit HSBC personal internet banking customers to perform a number of banking functions through the use of a personal computer or, for some functions, a mobile device on accounts linked to the service, including some accounts with our affiliates, such as HSBC Securities (USA) Inc. ("HSBC Securities"). Unless indicated otherwise by the context, "linked HSBC accounts" or "linked accounts" refers to all of your accounts with HSBC or its affiliates that you have linked to Personal Internet Banking. </p>

                                <p> When you use any of the Personal Internet Banking services described in this Agreement, or authorize others to use them, you agree to the terms and conditions of the entire Agreement. </p>

                                <p>  Your use of Personal Internet Banking services may also be affected by the agreements between us for your linked HSBC accounts. When you link an account to Personal Internet Banking services, you do not change the agreements you already have with us for that account. For example, if you link an HSBC Securities investment account to Personal Internet Banking, the terms and conditions of your HSBC Securities and Pershing LLC customer agreement(s) and/or user agreement(s) do not change. Similarly, when you use Personal Internet Banking services to access a credit account, you do so under the terms and conditions we gave you in the agreement and disclosure for the credit account. You should review those agreements for any applicable fees, for limitations on the number of transactions you can make, and for other restrictions that might impact your use of an account with Personal Internet Banking services. </p>

                        <h4> Rejection of Transfers</h4>
                        <p>We reserve the right to decline to effect any Bank to Bank Transfer, to submit Bank to Bank Transfer instructions or orders or to carry out change or cancellation requests.</p>
                        <br>
                        <h4>Authorization</h4>
                        <p>You authorize us to select any means to execute your Bank to Bank Transfer instructions. You understand that to effect your Bank to Bank Transfer instruction we utilize the Automated Clearing House (ACH), using applicable ACH Rules, we debit one of your Accounts and credit another of your Accounts. Once your Account has been debited, we credit our service provider's transfer account at the service provider's clearing bank. After our service provider and/or its clearing bank are reasonably certain that the debit will not be returned (in most cases this is usually between 3-4 business days), our service provider will credit your Account. The sole purpose for our service provider's transfer account is to complete your Bank to Bank Transfer requests and for performing the services within the scope of this Agreement. The service provider earns no interest on the funds in the transfer account. If the debit side fails or is returned for any reason and the credit side has been released and cannot be collected, you authorize our service provider to collect from the Account to which the credit side of the funds transfer was sent. We reserve the right to resubmit a debit, or a portion of the debit, in the event of an insufficient or uncollected funds return and if we cannot collect the amount credited. To effect this collection, you understand and authorize us to debit the credited Account or the debited Account in either the same dollar amount as the original funds transfer or a portion of the debit. There may be a fee associated with such collection imposed by the financial institution holding the Account.</p>
                        <p>You understand and agree that we may from time to time impose additional charges in connection with your Bank to Bank Transfers transactions. HSBC will notify you of such fee in advance of the transaction and according to applicable rules and regulations. If you choose to proceed with the transaction, you authorize HSBC to debit your account in the amount indicated.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>In the event that a debit to any of your Accounts, or any portion of any such debit, has failed and the credit side of such transaction has been released and cannot be collected, and we are unable to debit either the debited or the credited Account as set forth above, we reserve the right, and you hereby authorize us, to debit any of your other Accounts to the extent necessary to offset any resulting deficiency. We do not undertake to notify you in such event, other than by posting any such transfer or transfers to the applicable Account in accordance with this Agreement.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>You understand and agree that in the event we are unable to execute your Bank to Bank Transfers request utilizing the ACH, we may utilize other established payment mechanisms in order to complete your funds transfer instructions, such as wire transfer or check.</p>
                        <br>
                        <h4>Suspension and Reinstatement of Bank to Bank Transfers</h4>
                        <p>In the event that we at any time incur a problem with your use of the Service, including without limitation a failure in attempting to debit any of your Accounts or to collect with respect to any of your Bank to Bank Transfers as described above, and without limiting any other right or remedy that we may have under this Agreement or otherwise, we reserve the right to suspend your right to use the Service, immediately and without prior notice to you. You understand and agree that such action is reasonable for us to take in order to protect itself from loss. In the event of such suspension, you may request reinstatement of your service by contacting us using any of the methods provided for under this Agreement (see "Error Reporting and Claims," below). We reserve the right in our sole discretion to grant or deny reinstatement of your use of the Service. In the event we agree to reinstate you, we reserve the right to, and ordinarily will, initially reinstate your Service subject to lower per-transaction and monthly dollar limits and/or with other restrictions than otherwise might be available to you. Based upon your subsequent usage of the Service, HSBC in its sole discretion may thereafter restore your ability to effect transfers subject to such higher limits as may then be in effect (see "Dollar Amount of Transfers," above).</p>
                        <br>
                        <h4>Documentation</h4>
                        <p>You may access a statement of all Bank to Bank Transfers effected or pending at any time by clicking on the 'History' tab located within the Bank to Bank Transfers service. If a Bank to Bank Transfer could not be completed, HSBC and/or our service provider, upon learning that the Bank to Bank Transfer has failed, will make a reasonable effort to complete the transfer. If the Bank to Bank Transfer fails a second time, we will notify you to contact your financial institution or other provider of the relevant Account to learn more about the failure.</p>
                        <br>
                        <h4>Your Responsibility for Errors</h4>
                        <p>You understand that we must rely on the information provided by you and you authorize us to act on any instruction which has been or reasonably appears to have been sent by you, to submit Bank to Bank Transfer instructions on your behalf. You understand that financial institutions receiving the Bank to Bank Transfer instructions may rely on such information. We are not obliged to take any further steps to confirm or authenticate such instructions and will act on them without getting further confirmation. You understand that if you provide us with incorrect information or if there is any error in your instruction we will make all reasonable efforts to reverse or delete such instructions, but you accept full responsibility for losses resulting from any of your errors, duplication, ambiguities or fraud in the information that you provide. You agree not to impersonate any person or use a name that you are not authorized to use. If any information you provide is untrue, inaccurate, not current or incomplete, without limiting other remedies, HSBC reserves the right to recover from you any costs or losses incurred as a direct or indirect result of the inaccurate or incomplete information.</p>
                        <br>
                        <h4>Error Reporting and Claims</h4>

We are not responsible for errors, delays and other problems caused by or resulting from the action or inaction of financial institutions holding the Account. Although we will try to assist you in resolving any such problems, you understand that any such errors, delays or other problems are the responsibility of the relevant financial institution. Any rights you may have against a financial institution for such errors, delays or other problems are subject to the terms of the agreements you have with such financial institution, including any time limits during which complaints must be made.</p>

You may not copy, reproduce, distribute, or create derivative works, reverse engineer or reverse compile HSBC and/or our service provider's Bank to Bank Transfers or any of HSBC's and/or our service provider's services or technology.</p>

                        <h4>No Unlawful or Prohibited Use</h4>
                        <p>As a condition of using the Service, you warrant to us that you will not use the Service for any purpose that is unlawful or is not permitted, expressly or implicitly, by the terms of this Agreement or by any applicable law or regulation. You further warrant and represent that you will not use the Service in any manner that could damage, disable, overburden, or impair the Service or interfere with any other party's use and enjoyment of the Service.

                        <h4>Service Changes and Discontinuation</h4>
                        <p>We may modify or discontinue the Service or your use of some or all accounts within the service, with or without notice, without liability to you, any other user or any third party. We reserve the right, subject to applicable law, to terminate your account within the Service and your right to use the Service at any time and for any reason, including without limitation if we, in our sole judgment, believe you have engaged in conduct or activities that violate any of the Terms or the rights of HSBC and/or our service provider, or if you provide us with false or misleading information or interfere with other users or the administration of the Services. We reserve the right to charge a fee for the use of the Service and any additional services or features that we may introduce. You understand and agree that you are responsible for paying all fees associated with the use of our Bank to Bank Transfers.</p>

                        <br>
                        <h4>Service Charges</h4>
                        <p>There are no transaction fees when you transfer funds through the Bank to Bank Transfer service.
                        Security Procedures</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>You understand that the financial institution at which an Account is maintained may contact us to verify the content and authority of Bank to Bank Transfer instructions and any changes to those instructions. You understand that, as your agent, we may provide to such financial institution such information as may be required to verify the instructions and may constitute a valid security procedure under the rules governing such Account.</p>
                        <h4>Deviating from Security Procedures</h4>
                        <p>You agree to allow us to authorize any financial institution at which you have an Account to accept funds and transfer instructions in accordance with any authorization procedures as may be agreed from time to time between you and such financial institution, or between us, on your behalf, and such financial institution, without verifying the instructions under the established security procedures, regardless of whether such security procedures were agreed by you directly or by us on your behalf. In addition you agree that we may authorize such financial institutions to charge and debit your accounts based solely on these communications.</p>
                        <br>
                        <h4>Account Number Policy</h4>
                        <p>If Bank to Bank Transfer instructions identify a bank or beneficiary by name and account number, the relevant financial institution may execute those instructions by reference to the number only, even if the number does not correspond to the name. You understand that such financial institutions may not investigate discrepancies between names and numbers. In addition, you agree that we have no responsibility to investigate discrepancies between names and numbers.</p>
                        <br>
                        <h4>Joint Account Holder</h4>
                        <p>By using Bank to Bank Transfers, you confirm that, if any of your Accounts is a joint account, your joint account holder has consented for you to use your Accounts for the Service. We will end your use of the Service if any joint account holder notifies us that (i) they never consented to your use of our Bank to Bank Transfers service, (ii) the joint account can no longer be operated on your instructions alone, or (iii) they are withdrawing consent for you to operate the joint account.</p>
                        <br>
                        <h4>Means of Transfer</h4>
                        <p>You authorize us to select any means we deem suitable to provide your Bank to Bank Transfer instructions to the applicable financial institution. These choices include banking channels, electronic networks, and funds transfer systems. You agree to be bound by the rules and regulations that govern the applicable funds transfer systems, such as automated clearinghouse (ACH) as published by the National Automated Clearinghouse Association (NACHA). We shall make all reasonable efforts to ensure that your transfer requests are processed on time; however, we reserve the right to hold funds beyond the normal period and if any interest is earned will be the property of HSBC.</p>
                        <br>
                        <h4>Our Liability</h4>
                        <p>If we do not provide a funds transfer instruction on time, if we cause an incorrect amount to be removed from an Account or if we cause funds from an Account to be transferred to any account other than the Account specified in the applicable funds transfer instruction, we shall be responsible for returning the improperly transferred funds and/or for directing any misdirected funds to the proper Account. HSBC is not responsible or liable if your financial institution's system fails and we are unable to complete the transfer. Except as otherwise required by law, HSBC shall in no other event be liable for any losses and damages other than those arising from gross negligence or willful misconduct on our part or if we breach a representation or warranty of HSBC hereunder.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>You agree that your transfer instructions constitute authorization for us to complete the transfer. You represent and warrant to us that you have enough money in the applicable Accounts to make any Bank to Bank Transfer you request that we make on your behalf through the Service. You understand and agree that we are not liable under any circumstances for any losses or damages if, through no fault of ours, you do not have enough money to make the Bank to Bank Transfer and the Bank to Bank Transfer is not completed or is later reversed or if your financial institution does not permit the transfer or the Bank to Bank Transfer would exceed the credit limit on any applicable overdraft line.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>You also understand and agree that we are not responsible for any losses or damages if circumstances beyond our control (such as fire or flood) prevent us from making a Bank to Bank Transfer or if the HSBC website was not working properly and you knew about the breakdown when you started the Bank to Bank Transfer.</p>
                        <br>
                        <h4>Your Right to Cancel a Bank to Bank Transfer</h4>
                        <p>You can cancel or stop a single Bank to Bank Transfer any time before the debit transaction is sent to the Federal Reserve Bank through the Bank to Bank Transfers service in Personal Internet Banking. If the transfer is a recurring transfer set up on the Bank to Bank Transfers service, then you can cancel that Transfer through the use of Bank to Bank Transfers in Personal Internet Banking as long as the request is received before the Process Date of the next recurring transfer. Once a recurring transfer is cancelled, all future transfers will be cancelled and you must reschedule it if you want transfers to be made in the future.</p>
                        <br>
                        <h4>Limitation of Warranty and Liability</h4>

                        <br>
                        <p>EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH ON THE HSBC WEBSITE OR IN THIS AGREEMENT, WE DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION ANY WARRANTY OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGEMENT OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY OR THIRD PARTY RIGHTS, AND WE MAKE NO WARRANTY OR REPRESENTATION REGARDING THE RESULTS THAT MAY BE OBTAINED FROM THE USE OF THE BANK TO BANK TRANSFERS SERVICE, THE ACCURACY OR RELIABILITY OF ANY INFORMATION OBTAINED THROUGH THE BANK TO BANK TRANSFERS SERVICE, THE ACCURACY OF ANY INFORMATION RETRIEVED BY US FROM THE ACCOUNTS OR THAT THE BANK TO BANK TRANSFERS SERVICE WILL MEET ANY USER'S REQUIREMENTS, BE UNINTERRUPTED, TIMELY, SECURE OR ERROR FREE.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>EXCEPT AS DESCRIBED IN THIS AGREEMENT, WE WILL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES OF ANY KIND RESULTING FROM THE USE OF OR THE INABILITY TO USE THE BANK TO BANK TRANSFERS SERVICE, ANY INACCURACY OF ANY INFORMATION OR AMOUNT RETRIEVED BY US FROM THE ACCOUNTS, ANY BREACH OF SECURITY CAUSED BY A THIRD PARTY, ANY TRANSACTIONS ENTERED INTO BASED ON THE BANK TO BANK TRANSFERS SERVICE, ANY LOSS OF, UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS TO OR ALTERATION OF A USER'S TRANSMISSIONS OR DATA OR FOR THE COST OF PROCUREMENT OF SUBSTITUTE GOODS AND SERVICES, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF PROFITS, USE, DATA OR OTHER INTANGIBLES, EVEN IF WE HAD BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.</p>
                        <br>
                        <h4>Indemnification</h4>
                        <p>You agree to indemnify, defend and hold harmless HSBC, its service provider, its affiliates, partners, officers, directors, employees, consultants, service providers and agents from any and all third party claims, liability, damages and/or costs (including, but not limited to, attorneys' fees) arising from your use of the Bank to Bank Transfers service, our reliance on the information, instruction, license and/or authorization provided by you under or pursuant to this Agreement, your violation of the Terms or your infringement, or infringement by any other user of your Accounts, of any intellectual property or other right of any person or entity.</p>
                        <br>
                        <h4>Miscellaneous</h4>

                        <p>You agree that our rights and remedies arising out of any breach of your representations and warranties in this Agreement, the limitations on our liability and our rights to indemnification under this Agreement are continuing and shall survive the termination of this Agreement, notwithstanding the lack of any specific reference to such survivability in these provisions. HSBC's failure to enforce the strict performance of any provision of this Agreement will not constitute a waiver of HSBC's right to subsequently enforce such provision or any other provisions of this Agreement.</p>

                        <p>The most current version of this Agreement as it appears on our website, including any amendments that we may make from time to time, constitutes the entire agreement between us, and supersedes and replaces all other agreements or understandings, whether written or oral, regarding the Bank to Bank Transfers service. This Agreement may be amended, or any of HSBC's rights waived, only if HSBC agrees in writing to such changes, or you continue using the Bank to Bank Transfers service following receipt of notice of any changes proposed by HSBC. All notices to you shall be in writing and shall be made either by email, conventional mail or messages delivered through the Services, at HSBC's discretion. All notices to HSBC must be made in writing and sent to HSBC by registered or certified mail.</p>
